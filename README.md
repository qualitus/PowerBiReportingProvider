## Usage

This plugin works with an cron job. To manually start the export go to: ```Administration -> General -> Cron-Jobs -> PowerBi Export -> Execute```.

## Dependencies

This plugin requires the LpEventReportQueue plugin to be installed and configured.

## Troubleshooting

### 1. The Export does not create a file

Please check if the plugin is configured correct. Also check if the server 
path exists and the server user (mostly "www-data") has write access.<br/>
You may also check if the queue is not empty. The plugin will not create a file, 
if there is no data to export.<br/>
If the export already has created files before, it is possible that there is no 
new data since the last export.

### 2. The Cron-Job failed with "Plugin LpEventReportQueue is not available or not active."

Check if the LpEventReportQueue plugin is installed, configured and activated.

### 3. The Cron-Job stopped with "Task is currently running/locked"

The Cron-Job can't be executed in parallel and this state says thate is 
already running at the moment. If the job should be done already, you 
should check the log file for errors.
